# React App Collection

Welcome to the React App Collection! This is an ongoing project where I add individual, separate projects which will be various types of applications, all built using React. The purpose of this project is to learn and improve my knowledge of React, as well as to showcase my work and progress over time.

## What is included in this collection?

This collection currently includes a few basic applications such as a calculator, a to-do list, and a weather app. Each project is contained in its own subdirectory within the repository and is fully functional as a standalone application.

## How to run the applications

To run any of the applications in this collection, simply navigate to the corresponding subdirectory and run the following commands:

- npm install
- npm start

This will install any necessary dependencies and start the application. You can then access the application by opening your web browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000.

## Contributing

I welcome contributions to this project! If you have an idea for a new application to add to the collection or want to make improvements to an existing one, feel free to open a pull request or contact me directly.

Thank you for checking out my React App Collection!
