# React App Collection

Welcome to the React App Collection! This is an ongoing project where I add individual, separate projects which will be various types of applications, all built using React. The purpose of this project is to learn and improve my knowledge of React, as well as to showcase my work and progress over time.

Each project originates from it's own repository and is integrated within this one. You can run each individual repository as a standalone application. Each of their retrospective location can be found in the list below within the `What is included` section.

## What is included in this collection?
_Please select to see the repository for each project as a standalone application:_

#### What's coming next?

- Connect 4
- To Do List
