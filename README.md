# React App Collection

Welcome to the React App Collection! This is an ongoing project where I add individual, separate projects which will be various types of applications, all built using React. The purpose of this project is to learn and improve my knowledge of React, as well as to showcase my work and progress over time.

## What is included in this collection?

This collection currently includes a few basic applications such as a calculator, a to-do list, and a weather app. Each project is contained in its own subdirectory within the repository and is fully functional as a standalone application.

## Installation

To install and run the React App Collection, follow these steps:

1. Clone the `react-app-collection` repository using the `--recursive` option to ensure that the submodules are initialized and updated automatically: 

- clone --recursive https://github.com/SMelidoni/react-app-collection.git

If you have already cloned the repository with the `--recursive` option, you can skip to the next step.

2. If you have not used the `--recursive` option when cloning the repository, or if you have added a new submodule to the repository, you will need to initialize and update the submodules manually:

- git submodule init
- git submodule update

This will ensure that the submodules are properly initialized and updated to the latest version specified by the main repository.

3. Navigate to the root directory of the React App Collection and install the dependencies:

- cd react-app-collection
- npm install

4. Start the development server:

- npm start

You can then access the application by opening your web browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000.

## How to run the applications (individually)

To run any of the applications in this collection as a standalone app, simply navigate to the corresponding subdirectory and run the following commands:

- cd <subdirectory>
- npm install (If not done in step 3 above)
- npm start

You can then access the application as mentioned in point 4 above.
